        <h3>Video & Editing</h3>
        <p class="imovie-skill-description">I have most of my experience in iMovie. However, I am able to make creative videos with just a camera. I picked this up as a hobby when a co worker of mine asked for a video to promote a product he was selling.</p>

        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p class="gamedev-skill-description">I started making games in early 2020 using the <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity</a> game engine. I loved the idea of making my own game so I downloaded Unity and Visual Studio, bought a course on Udemy, and begin learning. In this regard, I am skilled in C#, animation, minimal game art, and sound design</p>
